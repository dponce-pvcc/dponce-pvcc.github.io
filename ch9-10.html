    <h4 class = "center_title">List four disadvantages of using assembly language:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Manage the movement of data items between and among memory locations and registers.</li>
        <li>The programmer must take a microscopic view of a task, breaking it down into tiny
            subtasks that direct what is going on in individual memory locations and registers.
        </li>
        <li>An assembly language program is machine specific.</li>
        <li>Satements are not natural-language-like.</li>
    </ol>
    </div>
    <div class = "boxes">
    <h4 class = "center_title">List four expectations programmers have for writing programs in a high-level language ("third generation" language):</h4>
    <ol>    
        <li>The programmer need not manage the details of the movement of data items within memory or pay
            any attention to exaclty where those items are stored.
        </li>
        <li>The programmer can take a microscpoic view of tasks, thinking at a higher level of problem solving.</li>
        <li>Programs are portable rather than machine specific.</li>
        <li>Programming statements are closer to natural language and use standard mathematical notation.</li>
    </ol>
    </div>
    <div class = "boxes">
    <h4 class = "center_title">Briefly describe or define:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Object code: System software that translates assembly languge instructions into binary machinelanguage instructions.</li>
        <li>Source code: High-level language instructions</li>
        <li>Procedural language: Consists of sequences of statements that manipulate data items.</li>
        <li>Integrated development environment (IDE):Lets programmers perform a number of tasks within the shell of a single application program,
            rather than having to use a separate program for each task.
        </li>
        <li>Software development life cycle: The overall sequence of steps needed to complete a large-scale software project. </li>
        <li>Waterfall model of software development: Software development is a completely sequential process.</li>
        <li>Agile model of softwawre development: A whole suite of methods and processes that helo; to promote a flexible 
            and ready response to meet a shifting and ever-changing target.</li>
    </ol>  
</div>
</div>
<div class = "boxes">
<h4 class = "center_title">Describe each of these components of the software development life cycle:</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Feasibility study: Evaluates a proposed projject and compares the costs and benefits of various solutions.</li>
    <li>Problem specification: Involves developing a clear, concise, and unambiguous statement of the exact problem the software is to solve.</li>
    <li>Program design: When it's clear what is to be done, the program design phase is the time to plan how it is to be done.</li>
    <li>Algorithm selection: Once the various subtasks have been identified, algorithms must be found to carry them out.</li>
    <li>Coding: is the process of converting the detailed designs into computer code.</li>
    <li>Debugging: is the process of locating and correcting program errors, and it can be a slow and expensive operation that requires as much effort as 
        writing the program in the first place.
    </li>
    <li>Testing: Test data that is carefully chosen to exercise all the different logic paths
        through a program can help uncover errors.
    </li>
    <li>Verification: can be used to prove that if the input data to a program satisfies certain conditions, then, after the 
        program has been run on this data, the output data satisfies certain other conditions.
    </li>
    <li>Documentation: all of the written and online material that makes a program understandable.</li>

    <p>Questions & Answers:</p>
    <p>Q: Why does the textbook refer to "the Tower of Babel" regarding computer languages?</p>  
    <p>A:Because there are multiple programming languages and not one that's universal to everyone.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Q: Why isn't there just one computer language?</p>
    <p>A:Each language was designed to meet the specific needs of one particular are of application.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Q: Why didn't FORTRAN use the less than symbol when comparing two numbers?</p>
    <p>A:The keypunches that were used to create the punced cards on which early Fortran programs
        were submitted to the computer had no such symbol.
    </p>    
    <br>
    <p>Q:What was COBOL designed for?</p>
    <p>A:COBOL was designed to serve business needs such as managing inventories and payrolls.</p>

    <p>A:It's essentially a giant collection of tools for software development.</p>
    <br>

    <p>A:SQL is designed to be used with databases, which are collections of related facts and information.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Q:What is R and what is it used for?</p>
    <p>A:R is a specialized programming language designed for statistical computing and graphics.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Q:What is Go (or golang) and what is it used for?</p>
    <p>A:Go is an open source language; the source code is available for anyone to examine and use, and changes 
        or additions can be proposed. Two of the target areas for Go applications are systems
        programming and programming for multicore machines.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>Q:What is Swift and what is it used for?</p>
    <p>A:Swift is programming language from apple and it was designed for building apps on the IOS and macOS operating systems.</p>

    <h4 class = "center_title">Briefly describe each of the following alternative programming paradigms</h4>
    <ol>    
        <li>Functional programming: Views every  task in terms of functions.</li>
        <li>Logic programming: Logic programming languages go a step further toward not specifying exactly how a task is to be done.</li>
        <li>Parallel programming: is the process of decomposing a problem into smaller tasks that can be executed at the same time using multiple compute resources.
