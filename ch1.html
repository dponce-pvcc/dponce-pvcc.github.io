    <h4 class = "center_title">Three misconceptions about Computer Science: </h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Computer Science is the study of computers.</li>
        <li>Computer science is the study of how to write computer programs.</li>
        <li>Computer science is the study of the uses and applications of computers and software.</li>
    </ol>
    </div>
    <div class = "boxes">
    <h4 class = "center_title">Briefly define:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Computer Science: The study of the principles and use of computers.</li>
        <li>algorithm: A procedure for solving a mathematical problem in a finite number
            of steps that frequently involves repetition of an operation; broadly;
            a step-by-step method for accomplishing some task.
        </li>
        <li>sequential operation: A sequential instruction carries out a single well
            defined task.When the task is finished, the algorithm moves on to the next
            operation.
        </li>
        <li>conditional operation: They ask the question, and the next operation is then 
            selectedon the basis of the answer to that question. 
        </li>
        <li>iterative operation: These are the looping instructions. They tell us 
            not to go on to the next instruction but, instead, to go back and repeat
            the execution of a previous block of instructions.
        </li>
        <li>stored program computer: A computer that stores instructions in its memory 
            to enable it to perform a variety of tasks in sequence or intermittently. </li>
        <li>programmer: Writes commands in a high-level language.</li>
        <li>integrated circuit: integrated circuits with transistors, resistors, and 
            capacitors were photographicallly etched onto a piece of silicon, which 
            further reduced the size and cost of computers.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h4 class = "center_title">Briefly describe these computer generations:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>First generation computer: The first appearance of UNIVAC I and the IBM 701, the
            first computer built by the company that would soon become a leader in this new field.
            They were used only by trained personnel and only in specialized locations.
        </li>
        <li>Second generation computer: A step up in computers with a major change in size and complexity. 
            Increase in reliability and reduced costs. They were ttainable by medium-sized businesses, 
            colleges, and government agencies. This was also the era of the appearance of FORTRAN and COBOL.
        </li>
        <li>Third generation computer: lasted from about 1965-1975. This era introduced the 
            intergrated circuit which further reduced the size and cost of computers. It also saw the birth of
            the sofware industry such as accounting packages and statistical programs. By this time, 
            they were no longer a rarity. 
        </li>
        <li>Fourth generation computer: roughly from 1975-1985. This era saw the appearance of the 
            first microcomputer. More software was developed, electronic mail is now being used, and graphical user 
            interfaces are available. Computers are being used in cars and household appliances. 
        </li>
        <li>Fifth generation computer: We are currently in this generation. So much is changing so fast that the concept
            of distinct generations of computer development has outlived its usefulness. A couple developments are: 
            <ul>
                <li>Ultra-high-resolution graphics for 3D imaging, animatin, movie making, video games, 
                    and virtual riality. 
                </li>
                <li>integrated digital devices incorporating data, television, telephone, camera, fax, 
                    the internet, and medical monitoring.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h4 class = "center_title">FORTRAN:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>What does the acronym FORTRAN stand for? - Formula Translation</li>
        <li>When was FORTRAN developed?- Created in 1954. Commercial release in 1957.</li>
        <li>What was it used for? - Fortran made code comprehensible to people with expertise 
            in fields other than computing, opening programming to mathematicians and scientists.</li>
        <li>Is FORTRAN still being used today? If so, what for? Yes. Doppler radar weather forecasts 
            or atmospheric and oceanic studies, as well as simulating nanoparticles, genomes, DNA and 
            atomic structures.</li>

    <ol>
        <li>What does the acronym COBOL stand for? - Common Business Oriented Language</li>
        <li>When was COBOL developed? - 1959</li>
        <li>What was it used for? - Common Business-Oriented Language (COBOL) is a programming language
            similar to English that is widely used to develop business-oriented applications in the area
            of commercial data processing.</li>
        <li>Is COBOL still being used today? If so, what for? - business, finance, and administrative systems 
            for companies and governments.</li>
