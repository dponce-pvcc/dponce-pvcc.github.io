    <h4 class = "center_title">Briefly describe or define:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Information Security: Protecting data from those who do not have permission to access it.</li>
        <li>Authentication: The process of verifying that you really are the person who has the right to access
            a particular device, whether it is your local machine or the remote server.
        </li>
        <li>Authorization: Governs what an authenticated user is allowed to do.</li>
        <li>Dual authentication: requires multiple forms of ID to access a device</li>
        <li>Social engineering: The process of using people to get the information you want</li>
        <li>Virus: A computer program that infects a host computer and then spreads.
            The virus copies itself and attacks other files on the system.
        </li>
        <li>Worm: It can send copies of itself to other nodes on a computer network
            without having to be carried by an infected host file.
        </li>
        <li>Trojan horse: A computer program that does some legitimate computational task but also,
            unbeknownst to the user, contains code to perfrom the same kinds of malicious attacks 
            as viruse and works-corrupt or delte files, and slow down the computer.
        </li>
        <li>Ransomware: Invades the user's computer and encrypts files on that computer.
            The author of the malware software, who holds the key can unlock the files.
            The attacker demands payment in order to releas the files.
        </li>
        <li>Phishing: is a practice used to illegally obtain sensitive information such as credit card 
            number, account number, and passwords.
        </li>
        <li>White hat: are the security experts who try to keep us safe in cyberspace.</li>
        <li>Black hats: are the bad guys who try to ferret out comoputer system weaknesses for financial
            gain, control, or outright destruction.
        </li>
        <li>encryption/decryption: encryption is the process of using an algorithm to convert information in a representation 
            that cannot be understood or utilized by anyone without the appropriate decryption algorithm; decryption is 
            the reverse of encryption, using an algorithm that converts the ciphtertext back into plain text.
        </li>
        <li>cryptography: is the science of "secret writing". </li>
        <li>symmetric encryption algorithm: requires the use of a secret key known to both the sender and the receiver.</li>
        <li>Caesar cipher: involves shifting each character in the message to another character some fixed distance farther along in the alphabet.</li>
        <li>Block cipher: a group or block fo plaintext letters gets encoded into a block of ciphertext, but not by substituting one character
            at a time for each letter.
        </li>
        <li>Data encryption Standard(DES): is an encryption algorithm developed by IBM and is certified as an international standard by the ISO.</li>
        <li>Public key system: the encryptionkey for messages to go to a particular receiver is broadcast to 
            everyone, but the decryption key cannot be derived from it and is known only by the receiver.
        </li>
        <li>embedded computers: are computational devices such as chips, processors, or computers that are embedded within anohter system.</li>

    <h4 class = "center_title">Briefly describe how a text file can be hidden in a steganographic image:</h4>
        <p>Steganography is the practice of hiding the very existence of a message. In this case, text hidden within images posted on the web. In the usual RGB format, 8 bits are allocated for each of the red, green, and blue color, from 0 to 255.
            The least significant bit contribues the least to the color intensity. Such a tiny change would not be detectable by the human eye.

    <h4 class = "center_title">List six ways to protect yourself from most cyber attacks</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>antivurs software installed</li>
        <li>Firewall software installed</li>
        <li>Up-to-date antispyware</li>
        <li>Setting the browser to use a pop-up blocker</li>
        <li>Install the latest security patches or updates to the operating system</li>
        <li>Don't give away personal or financial information to anyone</li>

<h4 class = "center_title">Brackets</h4>
<ol>
    <li>What's a bracket?: It's a modern text editor that makes it easy to design in the browser</li>
    <li>How much does it cost?: Free to download</li>
    <li>Describe several extensions you can download to enhance Brackets:
        <ul>Cacique Templates: Insert code from templates</ul>
        <ul>Clean Ally HTML: An extension to remove extraenous code from HTML</ul>
