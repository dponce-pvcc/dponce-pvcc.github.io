    <h4 class = "center_title">1.What is the purpose of a model?</h4>
    <p>Models are an important way of studying many physical and social phenomena.</p>
    <h4 class = "center_title">2.List four phenomena of a model:</h4>
        <p>a.Captures the ssence-the important properties-of the real thing</p>
        <p>b.Probably differs in scale from the real thing</p>
        <p>c.Omits some of the details of the real thing</p>
        <p>d.Lacks the full functionality of the real thing</p>

    <h4 class = "center_title">3.List four things a computing agent should be able to do:</h4>
        <p>a.Accept input</p>
        <p>b.Store information in memory and retrieve it from memory</p>
        <p>c.Take actions according to algorithm instructions; the choice of what action to take may 
            depend on the prosent state of the computing agent, as well as on the input item presently being processed.
        </p>
        <p>d. Produce output</p>

    <h4 class = "center_title">4.List four characteristics of an algorithm:</h4>
        <p>a.Be a well-ordered collection</p>
        <p>b.Consist of unambiguous and effectively computable operations</p>
        <p>c.Halt in a finite amount of time</p>
        <p>d.Produce a result</p>
    
    <h4 class = "center_title">5.What is the "halting problem" with regards to an uncomputable problem?</h4>
        <p>Decide, given any collection of Turning machine instructions together with any intial
            tape contents, whether that Turning machine will ever halt if started on that tape.

    <h3 class = "center_title">Define these terms:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Scientific method:entails observing the behavior of a system and formulating a hypothesis 
                that tries to understand and explain that behavior.</li>
            <li>Computational model: a physical system is not modeled as a samll-scale replica but as a set of 
                mathematical equations and/or algorithmic procedures that capture the fundamental properties 
                and behaviors of a system.
            </li>
            <li>Discrete event simulation: we do not model time as continuous, but as deiscrete. We model the 
                behavior a system only at an explicit and finite set of times.</li>
            <li>List and describe seven reasons to construct a simulation mode:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><i>Existance-</i>The system might not yet exist, so it is not possible to experiment directly on the actual system. In fact , we might 
                    be using a model to help us with the construction of the system.</li>
                    <li><i>Physical realization-</i>The system is not constructed from entities that can be represented by physical objects.</li>
                    <li><i>Safety-</i>It might be too dangerous to experiment on the actual system or a physical replica.</li>
                    <li><i>Speed of construction-</i>It migh take too much time to construct a physical model.Sometimes it is faster to design and build a computer
                    simulation.</li>
                    <li><i>Time scale-</i>Some physical systems change too slowly or too quickly.</li>
                    <li><i>Ethical behavior-</i>Some physical models have serious moral and ethical consequences, perhaps the best know being the use of animals
                    in medical research.</li>
                    <li><i>Ease of modification-</i>If we are not happy with the designn of a physical model, we need to construct a brand-new one.</li>
                </ul>
        </ol>
    <h3 class = "center_title">Illustris: "The Mother of All Computations"</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><i>What is Illustris? -</i>A research group from the Physics department of MIT reported that they had completed the most detailed and realistic computer 
            simulation ever built to study the formation of the universe. </li>
            <li><i>What fields of science were involved in the Illustris computational model? -</i>Physics, astronomy, hydrodynamics, chemistry, and mathematics</li>
            <li><i>What does Illustris simulate? -</i>The expansion of galaxies, the gravitational pull of matter, the formation of stars and black holes, and the motions of cosmic gases.</li>
            <li><i>How long did the project take? -</i>Five years</li>
            <li><i>How many years of gallactic evolution are simulated in Illustris? -</i>14 billion years of galactic evoulution.</li>
            <li><i>Illustris was created using two supercomputers. What is a supercomputer? -</i>A supercomputer is a computer with a high level of performance as compared to a 
                general-purpose computer. The performance of a supercomputer is commonly measured in floating-point operations per second instead of 
                million instructions per second. <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercomputer">Source</a></li>
